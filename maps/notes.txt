•supports more phases for moving and delays (50%)
•supports checkpoints (DONE)
•supports having only having 1 green area to act as start/end (DONE, reflect later)

more phases should be easy to implement.

a phase has this
x coord - y coord - x velocity - y velocity - delay

the problem is the added velocities, but we can simply have a new list.

we could possible abstract this into a class, but thats okay for now

so the pseudocode:

check if the positions equal to phase position

if so, perform delay
increment both index for velocity and position
carry on through
we might need to rework parsing of the object data tho, which is fine
