# WHGRL

implementation in java just to prototype. this project is making a gym environment for the flash game the worlds hardest game. can fully recreate all
levels from the original game by editing some text files. first 5 levels have already been created.

# NOTE

making levels is annoying as fuck so a level editor will be made to make it easier and more convinient. idk how long that will take. also looking to 
refactor the code and make it better in general, but im happy with the overall project for now. 

# TODO

level editor
migration to gym env
train using rl methods
